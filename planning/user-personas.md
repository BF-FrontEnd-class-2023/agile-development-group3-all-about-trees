# User Personas

We want to help users who know what a tree is but not much more than that, they
can come hear to begin learning more about trees. This site isn't designed for
tree experts.

The user persona format is:

- Bio

- Needs/Goals

- Frustrations

- Scenario 1

## High School Student

- **Bio**: Andrea is high school student taking her first biology class.
- **Needs/Goals**: She just needs enough information to write a 2-page report
  introducing trees.
- **Frustrations**: Most sources that talk about trees already assume you know
  quite a bit about plants and biology, this makes it challenging for her to get
  started on the report.
- **Scenario 1**: Andrea needs to do a 2-page report on trees and doesn't know
  where to start. She really does want to learn about trees, she would love to
  spend a month writing an in-depth report on them. But she also has a geometry
  test next week and an letter due for Dutch 101 so she's just trying to write
  the best report she can in a few days before moving on.
